					 <h1> INFORMATION</h1>
			             <p>Students will spend a day completing community service in a small group with friends in the Tawa basin, supervised by a staff member. This is a highly valuable experience where students have the chance to interact with the elderly helping them with gardening, painting etc or assisting local food banks, kindergartens, hospice shops and charities for the day.<br><br>Students will usually walk to their allocated job with a staff member, however a very small number of jobs will be on the fringes of the Tawa Basin and therefore they may be driven by a staff member in their groups.
