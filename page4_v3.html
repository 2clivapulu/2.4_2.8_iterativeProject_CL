					  <h1>DAY ONE</h1>
			              <p>Students will congregate with his form class. He will need to have his day pack/ backpack with lunch, water bottle, sun hat, a warm jumper/thermal and rain jacket. In addition, he will have one overnight bag, with the gear listed below, and a tent if you are providing one.The day pack must be separate from the overnight bag. Please wear appropriate sports clothing with lace up sports shoes with good grip. No denim please. Bring your own medication if required.<br><br>Once the roll has been taken, we will catch a private bus to Wainui. Students will be taken straight to camp Wainui where he will first construct a tent with his friends and put his overnight bag inside. We have a large camping area at the back of the camp, as well as the use of the hall and kitchen and toilets in the huts. There are a few showers available, but we would strongly discourage the use of the showers where possible as it takes a while for 260 people to shower, and we are only away for one night.<br><br>From here, Students will rotate through three activities at the camp, stopping for lunch between activities. The activities here are:<br>*Raft building, which also includes how to fit lifejackets correctly and how to use throw ropes<br>*Emergency bivvy making<br>*Search and rescue skills and team challenges <br><br>There will be some relaxing time before dinner in the hall. Dinner will be chilli mince and pasta (veg option available) with grated cheese and bread rolls with tinned fruit and ice cream for dessert.In the evening, we will play some camp games before everyone is sent back to their own tents for lights out at around 9.30pm.

					  <h1>DAY TWO</h1>
			             <p>We will wake nice and early and have a breakfast of cereals, toast and spreads. Tents will be packed down and overnight bags packed. These will be left in a pile ready for the buses to pick them up in the afternoon. <br><br> Students will take their day pack with their second lunch and a water bottle, rain jacket and warm top/hat and board the bus to go 7kms down the road to the Catchpool car park in the Remutaka Valley Park.<br> From here he will walk the Orongorongo track in and out of the valley (5.2km each way).<br><br> Please note, there is a track detour right at the end of the track due to a potential slip - we will be taking the detour that DOC has provided.<br>On the way Students will learn some map reading skills and about local flora and auna.<br><br>Once in the valley, students will have lunch and also:<br><br>*Learn how to build their own hobo stoves for cooking in the bush<br>*If the river is at its usual height of up to calf depth and not fast flowing, we will learn about river crossings. If there has been more rainfall than usual and the river is deeper or more fast flowing, this will be cancelled.<br><br>Then we will head back along the track to the car park, where a private bus will pick us up and transport us back to school for around 3.30pm.
