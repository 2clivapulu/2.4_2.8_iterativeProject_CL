					  <h1> INFORMATION</h1>
					 
			             <p>Each student will be given a timetable informing them of which trip they will do on which day. Click on the following links to see your Timetable for the Week. Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, Group 4. This includes transport and the cost of all activities.                               Due to the nature of the activities and the fixed costs involve, there will be no refunds given. Students are expected to bring a packed lunch on all of these days, as they will not have any opportunities to purchase lunch. Students will be required to                               wear appropriate mufti clothing on all days. This involves good walking/sports shoes, raincoat, sun block, and suitably warm clothing. Students will not   be allowed to participate in these trips if they do not have the correct gear. If you have any                                 difficulty supplying these required items, please indicate on the return form and we will endeavour to assist where possible.  On all trips, students will be expected to abide by the school rules.<br><br> This includes absolutely no cigarettes, drugs or                             alcohol. Students will be expected to conduct themselves in a  manner that is respectful to both supervising teachers and other students. Anyone who does not comply with these requirements will be sent back to school and/or home at the expense of their                              parents/caregivers. It is essential that all students on the trip play their part in risk management. Their personal safety is very much their responsibility, and they must always act in a manner that does not endanger either themselves or others. It is                              important that they follow the instructions of staff at all times. All these activities are compulsory but have been designed to be both education and fun. Students will be supervised at all times by Tawa College staff. If you have not already returned                              the permission forms  given out earlier this term, then please collect another copy of the forms from the school office, and hand them in to the student office along with $75.00 before Friday 25 October. If you have already returned the permission forms                              then you only need to pay the $75.00 before Friday 25 October.
